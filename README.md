# ScriptHub

## Adding your Scripts to [hub.pkgx.sh][ScriptHub]

1. Fork [pkgxdev/scripthub]
   * ðŸš¨ Forks of forks will not be indexed! ðŸš¨
2. Add scripts to `./scripts/`
   * Use any shell or scripting language you like
   * Scripts must use a [`pkgx` shebang]
   * Debug and test locally with `pkgx ./scripts/script-name`
   * Scripts do not have to be made executable: but we recommend it
3. **Optional Step** Rewrite the README so there is a `## script-name` section
   * The paragraph after the `##` will be the scripthub description
   * A `### Usage` section will be listed to help users use your script
   * If you donâ€™t provide usage then at some point we will use AI to try to
     generate it. Better you add it yourself tho right?
4. Push
5. Wait a bit and then check https://hub.pkgx.sh

### Debugging Scripts

You can easily test your scripts before publishing them with `pkgx`:

```sh
$ pkgx ./my-script
```

### Example Fork

https://github.com/mxcl/scripthub

## Using the Scripts

Once your scripts are visible at [ScriptHub] they can be used with the
ScriptHub cli `shub`:

```sh
$ shub your-script-name-without-extension
```

> If someone already took that name then you can still use it via:
>
> ```sh
> $ shub username/script
> ```

Notably, there is no secret sauce; users can just cURL the script and run it
directly via `pkgx`:

```sh
$ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mxcl/scripthub/main/scripts/stargazer
$ pkgx ./stargazer
```

Even `pkgx` isnâ€™t required, they can source the dependencies themselves and
run the script manually:

```sh
$ bash ./stargazer
# ^^ they will need to read the script to determine deps and interpreter
```

Hackers can use your script without installing `pkgx` first via our cURL
one-liner. This executes the script but doesnâ€™t install pkgx or any other
pkgs.

```sh
sh <(curl https://pkgx.sh) shub your-script-name
```
