# `mash`

mash up millions of open source packages into monstrously powerful scripts.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> We have not vetted any of the scripts `mash` can run and (currently) they
> can do anything they want to your computer.
>
> We fully intend to add sandboxing and user reporting, but you have found
> `mash` super early in its life so you must practice caution in your usage.
>
> All scripts can be read in advance via [mash.pkgx.sh]

&nbsp;


## Getting Started

```sh
$ mash  # or https://mash.pkgx.sh
# lists all script categories
```

You can browse script listings with the TUI or at [mash.pkgx.sh]:

```sh
$ mash ai  # or https://mash.pkgx.sh/ai/
# lists all ai scripts
```

> [!NOTE]
> The above lists all user submitted scripts in the `ai` category.

Once you’ve found a script you want to run:

```sh
$ mash ai chat --help  # or https://mash.pkgx.sh/ai/chat/
```

## Installing `mash`

To install `mash` and `pkgx`:

```sh
curl https://mash.pkgx.sh | sh
# ^^ installs /usr/local/bin/mash and  /usr/local/bin/pkgx
```

If you prefer, you can run `mash` via `pkgx`:

```sh
$ brew install pkgxdev/made/pkgx  # or curl https://pkgx.sh | sh
$ pkgx mash

# or install it via pkgx:
$ pkgx install mash
$ mash
```

> [!TIP]
> * `brew install pkgxdev/made/pkgx`; or
> * `curl https://pkgx.sh | sh`; or
> * [docs.pkgx.sh/getting-started](https://docs.pkgx.sh/getting-started)

`mash` is a plain POSIX script. All it needs is `bash`, `curl`, and `pkgx`.
So if you like you can just download it by itself.

> [!NOTE]
> Keeping mash so minimal isn’t a concrete design choice. We will entertain
> rewriting it in something better for dev as it gets more complicated.
>
> In fact the minimalist nature of `mash` is more a testament to `pkgx`’s
> powerful and composable packaging primitives.

## Contributing Scripts

### Making your Scripts available to `mash`

1. Fork [pkgxdev/mash]
2. Add scripts to `./scripts/`
3. Push to your fork
4. Wait an hour and then check [mash.pkgx.sh]

> [!TIP]
> * Use any shell or scripting language you like
> * Scripts do not need to use a [`pkgx` shebang] *but we recommend it*
> * Scripts do not have to be made executable *but we recommend it*
> * Extensions (eg. `.bash`, `.ts`) are *recommended* for GitHub readability.
>   They will be stripped from the mash execution name, eg. `foo-bar.ts` is
>   invoked via `mash foo bar` and not `mash foo bar.ts`

> [!NOTE]
> Do not create a pull request for your scripts against this repo!
> *We index the fork graph*.

### Running Your Scripts

`mash` operates with a “categorization by default is good” philosophy. Your
scripts must be categorized or namespaced with your user.

Thus if you add a script named `foo` it can only be used via
`mash username/foo`. But if you add a script called `foo-bar` if will be
listed if a user types `mash foo`:

```sh
$ mash foo

mash foo bar           # your description about `foo bar` is shown here
mash foo other-script  # …
```

To use the script the user would type `mash foo bar` or alternatively
`mash youruser/foo-bar`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `mash` will not be able to run your script until it is indexed.
> If you can see it listed at [mash.pkgx.sh] then you’re indexed.
> We index a few times an hour via the GitHub Actions committed to this repo.

> [!NOTE]
> Categorized scripts occur on a first come first served basis. If you create
> a script called `foo-bar` and someone already did that then you are too late
> and users can only call your script with `mash youruser/foo-bar`.

> [!NOTE]
> Updates are fetched automatically, there is no versioning at this time.

> [!NOTE]
> Single letter categorizations are ignored, eg `./scripts/f-u` will not be
> indexed or made available to mash. If you have a particularly good single
> letter category that you want an exception made, open a discussion and let’s
> chat!

> [!INFO]
> ### Naming Guidelines: A Call for Consideration
> Think for a little about the names you are picking. We reserve the right
> to rename egregious abuse of names and namespaces.

## Anatomy of Scripts

Thanks to [`pkgx`], `mash` scripts can be written in any scripting language
using any packages in the entire open source ecosystem.

### The Shebang

The shebang is where you instruct `pkgx` on what scripting language you want.
For example, if you want to write your script in `fish`:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env -S pkgx fish
```

You can also use pkgx `+pkg` syntax to add additional packages to the script’s
running environment:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env -S pkgx +gh +git +gum +bpb bash
```

pkgx knows what packages to cache (it doesn’t pollute the user system with
installs) based on the commands you want to run. There’s no figuring out
pkg names, just type what you would type to run the command.

### Documenting Your Script

Rewrite the README in your fork so there is a `## mash category scriptname`
section. If your script is not globally categorized then you would do
`## mash username/scriptname` instead.

* The paragraph after the `##` will be the [mash.pkgx.sh] description
  * Keep it short or it’ll get truncated when we display it
* If you add a `### Usage` section we’ll list it on the web

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you don’t provide a description your script won’t be listed (but the
> scripts can still be run by `mash`).

### Debugging Scripts

You can easily test your scripts before publishing:

```sh
$ chmod +x scripts/my-script
$ scripts/my-script
```

## Appendix

`mash` has no secret sauce; users can just cURL your scripts and run them
directly via `pkgx`:

```sh
$ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mxcl/mash/main/scripts/gh-stargazer
$ pkgx ./gh-stargazer
```

Even `pkgx` isn’t required, they can source the dependencies themselves and
run the script manually:

```sh
$ bash ./stargazer
# ^^ they will need to read the script to determine deps and interpreter
```

Hackers can use your script without installing `pkgx` or `mash` first via our
cURL one-liner. This executes the script but doesn’t install anything:

```sh
sh <(curl https://mash.pkgx.sh) <category> <scriptname>
```
